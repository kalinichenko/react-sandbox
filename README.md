# React web for native

This is simply a sandbox, that can be used as a starting point for building platform agnostic app based with react and react-native. It's created with an idea to share business logic between web-app and native-app, but not to bring difficulties aligning UI for such a different platforms.

#### `npm start`

Runs your web app in development mode with an interactive prompt.


#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).


#### `npm run ssr`

Like `npm start`, but prerender your web apps before serving it.
